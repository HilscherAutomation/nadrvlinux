HILSCHER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT 

This document is a legally valid contract between you and Hilscher Gesellschaft für Systemautomation mbH (“Hilscher”).

Please read through this License Agreement carefully before installing and using the software. By installing the software and using it, whether in whole or in part, you accept all of the provisions of this Agreement.

If you decline to accept these terms and conditions, please do not install the software. Instead, return it to us or the retailer from which you purchased it for a refund of the purchase price.

1. Copyright
This software program (the “Software”) is protected under German and international copyright law as well as under international laws and regulations governing commerce and the protection of intellectual property. The Software is provided under a paid license and is not available for sale. Hilscher retains all ownership rights thereto, including all intellectual property rights. You are granted a non-exclusive license.

2. License
The Software is supplied as a licensed version. This version can be used to control two units and may be installed and copied without limitation in order to use it with other products from Hilscher.

You are not permitted to convert the Software, and particularly the program code, back into another code form (decompilation / disassembly) or otherwise trace the various stages the Software has undergone during production thereof (reverse engineering), or to make any changes, additions, or modifications to the program except as permitted within the scope absolutely granted under copyright law (Sections 69 d and 69 e of the Copyright Act of the Federal Republic of Germany). You are permitted to remedy errors or to change the program in order to adapt it to new provisions of applicable law or regulations or to adjust it for different hardware, provided that you are doing so for your own use only and that the modified program is not intended for commercial exploitation in any manner whatsoever vis-à-vis external parties.

Changes, additions, or modifications may not, however, be carried out unless and until Hilscher has been granted two opportunities, beforehand, to eliminate the error in question. You are not entitled to any rights of use and enjoyment with regard to the results of such editing work aside from the rights of use granted hereunder.

Decompilation is permitted only within the limits stipulated in Section 69 e of the Copyright Act of the Federal Republic of Germany and is also permitted only if Hilscher has received a written request to resolve the problem and has been granted an adequate cure period and has not provided the necessary data or information in order to ensure that the Software is compatible with other software or hardware.

Hilscher grants you the right to install and use the Software on any one personal computer that is not connected to a network, or for one workstation within a multiple-workstation computer system, or on one individual computer within a locally delimited network. If you intend to use the Software on another computer or on other hardware, it must be deleted from the computer or hardware on which it was previously used. Simultaneous storage, retention, or use of the Software on more than one computer is not permitted. If you would like to use the Software on multiple computers or hardware configurations at the same time, such as if multiple employees use the Software, you are required to purchase the corresponding number of Software packages.

Use of the Software within a network or a multiple-station computing system is not permitted if and insofar as such use creates an opportunity for the simultaneous use of the Software in multiple locations or by multiple users. If you would like to use the Software within a network or other multiple-station computing system, you are required to prevent simultaneous use thereof by means of access mechanisms. Otherwise, you are required to obtain a separate license for each user connected to the network, or a network license oriented toward the number of users connected to the computing system.

The Software and the images, photographs, and text of the printed materials accompanying it (user manual, accompanying text, documentation, etc.) are protected under copyright and are the property of Hilscher.

Duplication of the Software is permitted only if and insofar as necessary for the use thereof in accordance with this Agreement. You are permitted to make backup copies according to the current state of the art and in the number and scope necessary. Backup copies on portable data storage media must be labeled as copies and must bear a copyright notice.

If you purchased the Software via an online download, you are entitled to copy it to a data storage medium. In all other respects, the rights of Hilscher to the online copy shall lapse in the same manner as if the Software had been supplied on a data storage medium.

Copyright notices, serial numbers, and other characteristics that serve to identify the program must not be removed under any circumstances.

Beyond the rights of use granted herein, you are not permitted to make copies of the Software or any portion thereof. Making copies of the written material accompanying the Software is expressly prohibited.

The rights of use granted by Hilscher will take effect only after you have paid the contractually owed licensing fee in full.

3. Software Service Agreement
Hilscher will supply you with all updates and upgrades concerning the Software free of charge for a period of twelve (12) months as from the date of purchase. After this period, you can enter into a supplementary software service agreement with Hilscher to ensure that your Software is always up to date and that you receive the latest version thereof.

4. Termination
The provisions hereof governing licensing shall continue in force until this Agreement is terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of the Software. Hilscher will automatically terminate your license without further notice if you violate the provisions or conditions of this License Agreement. In such a case, you are obligated to destroy all copies of this Software and all parts and components, irrespective of the form thereof.

5. Warranty
Hilscher cannot guarantee that the Software will meet your requirements, that you will enjoy uninterrupted use thereof, or that the Software is free of errors and defects.

Hilscher’s warranty extends, at its own option, to subsequent performance or to reimbursement of the purchase price. A defect is also deemed to have been remedied if Hilscher notifies you of reasonable ways to avoid the effects of the defect in question. Nothing herein shall affect the rights of the Parties to rescind this Agreement or reduce the payment owed hereunder; these rights must be asserted by way of written notice. If Hilscher performs services during troubleshooting or remediation of errors without being obligated to do so, Hilscher is entitled to demand remuneration for such services in accordance with the customary fees. This applies in particular if the presence of a defect cannot be proven or if the defect is not attributable to Hilscher.

With the exception of the abovementioned limited warranty with regard to a licensed full version of the Software, Hilscher disclaims any and all other warranties, whether express, implied, or of any other nature. Likewise, Hilscher makes no warranty that it will not assign rights to another party or any warranty regarding the ownership rights to the Software, or that the Software is free of interventions by third parties.

Using the Software for military purposes, or utilizing it in applications or systems in which potential Software malfunctions might, as far as it is humanly possible to determine, cause or entail bodily injury or injuries leading to death, is prohibited. If you use the Software in such an environment, you do so at your own risk. The Software is not designed, intended, or licensed for use in dangerous environments that demand fail-safe control mechanisms.

Use of the Software is strictly prohibited in the fields of design, construction, maintenance, or operation of nuclear facilities and of air traffic control or air communications systems, as well as the field of life support or weapons systems. Hilscher disclaims any and all liability for damage or losses resulting from such use of the Software in violation of this provision.

6. Disclaimer
The Software was produced and tested by Hilscher with care and is provided to you purely as is. Hilscher cannot make any warranty that the Software is functional or free of errors with regard to all conditions and cases arising in the application thereof, or for the results of work produced when the Software is used by the user.

Hilscher makes no further representations or warranties and grants no further provisions or conditions (whether express or implied, arising from a business relationship or customary practice, or derived from statutory, common-law, or other laws and regulations) with regard to the Software’s merchantability, freedom from defects in title, suitability for integration or usability for particular purposes, unless such representations, warranties, and/or provisions are stipulated under applicable law and cannot be restricted.

In all cases of contractual or non-contractual liability, Hilscher shall pay damages only within the following limits:

a) In the case of wrongful intent, Hilscher shall pay damages in the full amount. In the case of gross negligence, Hilscher is liable only if and insofar as the damage or loss in question is foreseeable and typically occurs in such situations and the obligation that has been violated should have prevented it. Hilscher disclaims all liability for gross fault on the part of its agents in performance of its contractual representative or vicarious agents vis-à-vis commercial business entities if the present Agreement pertains to such entities’ commercial business operations, unless the fault lies with executive representatives in performance of Hilscher or primary contractual obligations have been violated. Hilscher is likewise liable in the event that the Software does not display a characteristic quality warranted by Hilscher.

b) Hilscher is liable for ordinary negligence only if and insofar as compliance with the obligation that has been violated is especially important to achieving the purpose of this Agreement (cardinal obligation). In the event of violation of a cardinal obligation, Hilscher’s liability is limited to the damage or losses that can typically be expected to occur in the context of provision of software.

c) Liability for data loss is limited to the typical costs of restoration thereof that would be incurred if backup copies were made regularly and in accordance with the level of risk in question.

d) Nothing herein shall affect the liability of Hilscher for personal injury or its liability pursuant to the Produkthaftungsgesetz (Product Liability Act of the Federal Republic of Germany).

7. Disclosure and Obligations to Provide Information
You are permitted to provide the Software to a third party only in full and only if you terminate, completely and permanently, your own use thereof, and provided that the third party obtaining such Software states that it agrees that the present terms and conditions of licensing will continue to apply.

Temporary or partial paid provision of the Software to third parties for their use (leasing, rental) is prohibited, irrespective of whether the objects of this Agreement are provided in tangible or intangible form. The same applies in the event of unpaid provision thereof to third parties. You are not permitted to provide the Software to third parties if there is good cause to suspect that the third party in question will violate the provisions of this Agreement.

In the event of resale of the Software, you are obligated to notify Hilscher of the name and full address of the buyer thereof.

8. Compliance with Export Laws and Regulations
The Software must not be exported to countries to which the export thereof is prohibited under U.S. Commerce Department Export Control Laws (http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm) and the provisions thereof. Within the scope of this License Agreement, you represent and warrant that you will not export or re-export the Software to any country that is subject to U.S. export restrictions, or provide it through export or re-export to any natural person, legal entity, or end user that or who is subject to U.S. export restrictions. You agree that you will not provide the Software to any country that is subject to U.S. export restrictions or to any citizen of any such country, irrespective of where such person resides or stays, if such person intends to import the products to any such country, and that you will not provide the Software to end users of whom you know or suspect that they will use the Software, or any portion thereof, for the design, development, or production of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, and that you will not provide the Software to any end user banned by any federal agency of the United States government from participating in U.S. export transactions.

9. Obligation to Inspect the Software and Complain of Defects
You are obligated to inspect the Software, and the pertinent services provided in the performance of this License Agreement in accordance with Section 377 of the Handelsgesetzbuch (Commercial Code of the Federal Republic of Germany) and to complain of any defects found therein. Complaints regarding defects must contain as detailed a description of the defect or defects in question as possible. In the event of violation of your obligation to inspect the Software and complain of any defects therein, the Software will be deemed to have been approved in consideration of the defect in question.

10. Duty to Exercise Care in Custody of Materials
The original data storage media supplied must be stored in a location that is secured against unauthorized access by third parties. Employees must be expressly notified of the obligation to comply with the present terms and conditions of licensing and with copyright law and regulations.

11. Miscellaneous Provisions; Severability
This License Agreement is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. In all cases, this License Agreement shall be interpreted and applied without regard for the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

Should it transpire that any part of this Agreement is invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, such circumstance shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remainder hereof.

Amendments to this Agreement are not valid unless made in written form. Amendments to this clause must also be made in written form.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior understandings, purchase agreements, arrangements, and agreements with regard to the Software that is the subject of the license granted hereunder, unless you have entered into a written agreement otherwise with Hilscher. These terms and conditions of licensing apply in addition to the general terms and conditions of trade (GTCT) of Hilscher.
